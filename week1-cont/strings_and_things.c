/*
 6. Given two strings: print true if they are equal and false if they are not equal.
 7. Given a string “This is a test”, replace te with gho
 • Try with strings that don’t contain te
 8. You have an array of strings. Create a new string, which is a concatenation of all the array elements.
 • Check that the length of individual strings when added equals the length of the final string
 • Make sure your program works with an array with no elements
 9. Given this string: “USA, Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, Grenada, Belize” -- create an array that contains these countries as its elements. Note: the comma is the separator
 • Make sure your program works when you add or remove countries from your string
 • Change your program so that the delimiter can be easily changed
 10. Modify the program in 9 above so it can understand countries separated by either a comma or a space or a period. “USA. Canada, Mexico, Bermuda Grenada, Belize”
 11. Change your program so that it can support any number of delimiters.
